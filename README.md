# Installing Software

It's always a task when you have a new laptop or desktop to build.  It's time consuming finding and installing software. 

Within this repository you will find two scripts, one that utitlises Windows Package Manager, the other which utilises Chocolately. 

Each script asks the user for input as to whether or not they want to install some software. If the user says Yes then the software will be installed for them using either Windows Package Manager or Chocolately.
